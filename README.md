# orbital-fingerprint

 We used molecular characterization (hybrid orbitals and electron distribution) to construct a mathematical model to evaluate the ability to form hydrogen bonds and named it with lone-pair electron (LPE).To comprehensively explore molecular interaction, using molecular properties including the hybrid orbital forms of each atom, atomic bonding types, and the adjacency list of atoms, we constructed a molecular fingerprint and named it orbital fingerprint. Then a graph neural network (GNN) for compounds was constructed using orbital fingerprint. A prediction for molecular interaction (PMI) was performed by combining this GNN and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for proteins.
 We obtained the human dataset that contains highly credible 3369 positive and 3359 negative interactions between 1052 unique compounds and 852 unique proteins from website (https://github.com/masashitsubaki/CPI_prediction/tree/master/dataset/human).
 We combined a graph neural network (GNN) for compounds(20) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for proteins(21) (Figure 2a&b) to constructs the artificial neural networks model PMI for predicting molecular interaction(22).

## The calculation of the lone-pair electron (LPE) index
The molecule structure was converted to simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) format using RDKit (Open-source cheminformatics; http://www.rdkit.org). And we used the Chem module of RDKit to calculate the numbers of lone pair electrons and the numbers of the sp2- and sp3-orbitals of each molecules. Then the LPE index was calculated using the formula: 
<div align=center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;\bg_white&space;\fn_cs&space;\huge&space;LPE=&space;\frac{\sum^{n}_{1}N_i^e}{N_{sp^2}&space;&plus;&space;N_{{sp}^3}}" width="150" height="150" alt="LPE formula" /></div>

where 
![N_i^e](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;\bg_white&space;\fn_cs&space;N_i^e) is the number of lone paired electron of the 
![i](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;\bg_white&space;\fn_cs&space;i)-th atom; 
![N_{sp^2}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;\bg_white&space;\fn_cs&space;N_{sp^2}) and 
![N_{sp^3}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;\bg_white&space;\fn_cs&space;N_{sp^3}) are the numbers of 
![sp^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;\bg_white&space;\fn_cs&space;sp^2)- and 
![sp^3](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;\bg_white&space;\fn_cs&space;sp^3)-hybridized atoms, respectively. 


## The construction of the orbital fingerprint
The molecule graph is represented as g=(V,E) to the molecular graph, where v_i∈V is the hybridization type (e.g., sp2 and sp3) of i-th atom and ε_ij∈E is the chemical bond type (e.g., single and double) between the i-th and j-th atoms. Since biomolecules are kind of complex, the above graph is far enough to decipher tiny differentiation between molecules owning close structure, the r-radius subgraphs as an effective make-up strategy was applied as well. The r value is defined as the number of hops from a core atom. In the present study, r = 2 was used the number of time steps in a graph neural network to predict the molecule interaction because it has already proved that the depth of two steps. To be more precise, we described the hybridization types of neighboring atoms and chemical bonds types within the radius of the two atoms from the i-th vertex as N_v and N_e, respectively. Then we used the different non-negative integers to represent the different types of N_v and N_e, and we assigned an embedding to characterize a specific molecule. For example, [CH2=CH-CH2-CH3] could be described by different r-radius subgraphs (r = 2) as “sp2=sp2-sp3”, “sp2=sp2-sp3-sp3”, “sp2=sp2-sp3-sp3”, and “sp2-sp3-sp3”. Based on this, we dispatched four non-negative integers 0, 1, 1, and 2 to the above four orbital expressions, respectively. Therefore, we could use the vector (0, 1, 1, 2) to represent this molecule. To be more precisely characterize the molecule, the adjacency list of atoms was also considered in the molecular graph. Therefore, by graphing each atomic hybrid orbital, we define a very different representation of molecule, which we name it as an orbital fingerprint. The detailed construction steps of the orbital fingerprint are shown in https://github.com/GongCongCong/orbital-fingerprint. 

## PMI

Here, we reference the CPI approach (https://github.com/masashitsubaki/CPI_prediction) to predict compound-protein interaction. But the input information of PMI for the compound is the orbital fingerprint.

To apply graph neural network (GNN) for compounds(14), we first analyzed the hybrid orbitals of each atom and its neighbor atoms, and then constructed the molecule fingerprint and named it with orbitals fingerprint (Figure 2a&b). Orbitals fingerprint contains the hybrid orbitals information of each atom of the molecule alone, its relationship with its neighboring atoms (within 2-radius), and the information of the adjacency list of atoms, suggesting orbitals fingerprint could be used to predict molecular interaction. To apply convolutional neural network (CNN) to proteins(23), we split the protein sequences into overlapping 3-gram amino acids (triplets of sequentially contiguous amino acid). Then we assigned an embedding (i.e., vector) to characterize the protein depending on the different amino acid fragments (Figure 2). For example, the sequence of one protein is “TAEYVE”. Therefore, this protein sequence was split to be “TAE”, “AEY”, “EYV”, and “YVE”, and we defined a vector (0, 1, 2, 3) to represent this protein(16).
